        <p>Welcome to <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>, an introductory book about Rust. The Rust
          programming language helps you write faster,
          more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
          language design; Rust challenges that conflict.
          Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience,
          Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage)
          without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h2">Who Rust Is For</h2>
        <p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of the most important
          groups.</p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Teams of Developers</h3>
        <p>Rust brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing
            dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.</li>
          <li>Rustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.</li>
          <li>The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration for code
            completion and inline error messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be productive while writing
          systems-level code.</p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Students</h3>
        <p>Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems concepts.
          Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating systems development.
          The community is very welcoming and happy to answer student questions.
          Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to make systems concepts more accessible to
          more people,
          especially those new to programming.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Companies</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety of tasks.
          Those tasks include command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded devices,
          audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search engines, Internet
          of Things applications,
          machine learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Open Source Developers</h3>
        <p>Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community, developer tools, and
          libraries.
          We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust language.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h2">Installation</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="main-section__content">
        <p>The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through <code class="hlcode">rustup</code>,
          a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.
          You’ll need an internet connection for the download.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note: If you prefer not to use <code class="hlcode">rustup</code> for some reason,
            please see the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank">Rust
              installation page</a> for other options.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
          Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that compile will continue to
          compile with newer Rust versions.
          The output might differ slightly between versions, because Rust often improves error messages and
          warnings. In other words, any newer,
          stable version of Rust you install using these steps should work as expected with the content of
          this documentation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Command Line Notation</h3>
          <p>In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the terminal.
            Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with <code class="hlcode">$</code>.
            You don’t need to type in the <code class="hlcode">$</code> character; it indicates the start of
            each command.
            Lines that don’t start with <code class="hlcode">$</code> typically show the output of the
            previous command.
            Additionally, PowerShell-specific examples will use <code class="hlcode">&gt</code> rather than
            <code class="hlcode">$</code>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Installing <code class="hlcode">rustup</code> on
          Linux or macOS</h3>
        <p>If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command: </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf  |  sh</pre>
        <p>The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the <code class="hlcode">rustup</code> tool,
          which installs the latest stable version of Rust.
          You might be prompted for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">Rust is installed now. Great!</pre>
        <p>If you prefer, feel free to download the script and inspect it before running it.<br> </p>
        <p>The installation script automatically adds Rust to your system PATH after your next login.
          If you want to start using Rust right away instead of restarting your terminal,
          run the following command in your shell to add Rust to your system PATH manually:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ source $HOME/.cargo/env</pre>
        <p>Alternatively, you can add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:</p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"</pre>
        <p>Additionally, you’ll need a linker of some kind. It’s likely one is already installed,
          but when you try to compile a Rust program and get errors indicating that a linker could not execute,
          that means a linker isn’t installed on your system and you’ll need to install one manually.
          C compilers usually come with the correct linker. Check your platform’s documentation for how to install a C
          compiler.
          Also, some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C compiler. Therefore, it might be worth
          installing one now.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this line:</p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ rustc --version</pre>
        <p>You should see the version number, commit hash,
          and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released in the following format:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)</pre>
        <p>If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don’t see this information and
          you’re on Windows,
          check that Rust is in your <code class="hlcode">%PATH%</code> system variable. If that’s all correct and Rust
          still isn’t working,
          there are a number of places you can get help. The easiest is the #beginners channel on
          <a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang">the official Rust Discord</a>.
          There, you can chat with other Rustaceans (a silly nickname we call ourselves) who can help you out.
          Other great resources include <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">the Users forum</a> and
          <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust">Stack Overflow</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Local Documentation</h3>
        <p>The installation of Rust also includes a copy of the documentation locally, so you can read it offline.
          Run rustup doc to open the local documentation in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not sure what it does or how to
          use it,
          use the application programming interface (API) documentation to find out!

      <div class="main-section__content">
        <p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, let’s write your first Rust program.
          It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text
          <code class="hlcode">Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line.
            Rust makes no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives,
            so if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of the command line,
            feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s
            documentation for details.
            Recently, the Rust team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support, and progress has been made rapidly
            on that front!
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Creating a Project Directory</h3>
        <p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter to Rust where your code lives,
          but for the exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a projects directory in your home directory
          and keeping all your projects there.
        </p>
        <p>Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a projects directory and a directory for the “Hello,
          world!”
          project within the projects directory.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:</li>
          <pre class="bash-code">
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</pre>
          <li>For Windows CMD, enter this:</li>
          <pre class="bash-code">
&gt mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
&gt cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
&gt mkdir hello_world
&gt cd hello_world
</pre>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Writing and Running a Rust Program</h3>
        <p>Next, make a new source file and call it <span class="italic">main.rs</span>.
          Rust files always end with the <span class="italic">.rs</span> extension.
          If you’re using more than one word in your filename, use an underscore to separate them.
          For example, use <span class="italic">hello_world.rs</span> rather than <span
            class="italic">helloworld.rs</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Now open the main.rs file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.</p>
        <p>Filename: <span class="italic">main.rs</span></p>
        <pre class="hlcode"><span class="hlcode--function">fn</span> <span class="hlcode--def">main</span>() {
                    <span class="hlcode--def">println!</span>(<span class="hlcode--content">"Hello, world!"</span>);
                }</pre>
        <p>Listing 1-1: A program that prints <code class="hlcode">Hello, world!</code></p>
        <p>Save the file and go back to your terminal window. On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile
          and run the file:</p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!</pre>
        <p>On Windows, enter the command <code class="hlcode">.\main.exe</code> instead of <code
            class="hlcode">./main:</code></p>
        <pre class="bash-code">&gt rustc main.rs
&gt .\main.exe
Hello, world!</pre>
        <p>Regardless of your operating system, the string <code class="hlcode">Hello, world!</code> should print to the
          terminal. If you don’t see this output,
          refer back to the <a
            href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting">“Troubleshooting”</a> part
          of the Installation section for ways to get help.
        </p>
        <p>If <code class="hlcode">Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust
          program.
          That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Anatomy of a Rust Program</h3>
        <p>Let’s review in detail what just happened in your “Hello, world!” program. Here’s the first piece of the
          puzzle:</p>
        <pre class="hlcode"><span class="hlcode--function">fn</span> <span class="hlcode--def">main</span>() {

                }</pre>
        <p>These lines define a function in Rust. The <code class="hlcode">main</code> function is special:
          it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
          The first line declares a function named <code class="hlcode">main</code> that has no parameters and returns
          nothing. If there were parameters,
          they would go inside the parentheses, <code class="hlcode">()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Also, note that the function body is wrapped in curly brackets, <code class="hlcode">{}</code>.
          Rust requires these around all function bodies.
          It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one
          space in between.
        </p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, an automatic formatter tool called <code class="hlcode">rustfmt</code> is under
          development.
          If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects,
          <code class="hlcode">rustfmt</code> will format your code in a particular style.
          The Rust team plans to eventually include this tool with the standard Rust distribution, like <code
            class="hlcode">rustc</code>.
          So depending on when you read this book, it might already be installed on your computer!
          Check the online documentation for more details.
        </p>
        <p>Inside the <code class="hlcode">main</code> function is the following code:</p>
        <pre class="hlcode">

                    <span class="hlcode--def">println!</span>(<span class="hlcode--content">"Hello, world!"</span>);</pre>
        <p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen.
          There are four important details to notice here. First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
        </p>
        <p>Second, <code class="hlcode">println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead,
          it would be entered as <code class="hlcode">println</code> (without the <code class="hlcode">!</code>).
          We’ll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 19.
          For now, you just need to know that using a <code class="hlcode">!</code> means that you’re calling a macro
          instead of a normal function.
        </p>
        <p>Third, you see the <code class="hlcode">"Hello, world!"</code> string. We pass this string as an argument to
          <code class="hlcode">println!</code>,
          and the string is printed to the screen.
        </p>
        <p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (<code class="hlcode">;</code>), which indicates that this
          expression is over and the next one is ready to begin.
          Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</h3>
        <p>You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the process.</p>
        <p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the <code
            class="hlcode">rustc</code>
          command and passing it the name of your source file, like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ rustc main.rs</pre>
        <p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to <code class="hlcode">gcc</code> or
          <code class="hlcode">clang</code>.
          After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.
        </p>
        <p>On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by entering the <code
            class="hlcode">ls</code> command in your shell.
          On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll see the same three files that you
          would see using CMD.
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ ls
main  main.rs</pre>
        <p>With CMD on Windows, you would enter the following:</p>
        <pre class="bash-code">&gt dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</pre>
        <p>This shows the source code file with the .rs extension, the executable file (main.exe on Windows,
          but main on all other platforms), and, when using Windows, a file containing debugging information with the
          .pdb extension.
          From here, you run the main or main.exe file, like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows</pre>
        <p>If main.rs was your “Hello, world!” program, this line would print <code class="hlcode">Hello, world!</code>
          to your terminal.</p>
        <p>If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or JavaScript,
          you might not be used to compiling and running a program as separate steps.
          Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to
          someone else,
          and they can run it even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a <span class="italic">.rb</span>,
          <span class="italic">.py</span>, or <span class="italic">.js</span> file,
          they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively). But in those
          languages,
          you only need one command to compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.
        </p>
        <p>Just compiling with <code class="hlcode">rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows,
          you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code. Next,
          we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write real-world Rust programs.

        <p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.
          Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you,
          such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.
          (We call libraries your code needs <span class="italic">dependencies</span>.)
        </p>
        <p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any dependencies.
          So if we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it would only use the part of Cargo that handles
          building your code.
          As you write more complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project using Cargo,
          adding dependencies will be much easier to do.
        </p>
        <p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this book assumes that you’re using Cargo
          too.
          Cargo comes installed with Rust if you used the official installers discussed in the
          <a href="#installation">“Installation”</a> section. If you installed Rust through some other means,
          check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following into your terminal:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">$  cargo  --version</pre>
        <p>If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as <code class="hlcode">command not
            found</code>,
          look at the documentation for your method of installation to determine how to install Cargo separately.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main-section__title main-section__title--h3">Creating a Project with Cargo</h3>
        <p>Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our original “Hello, world!” project.
          Navigate back to your projects directory (or wherever you decided to store your code).
          Then, on any operating system, run the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="bash-code">
$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo</pre>
        <p>The first command creates a new directory called <span class="italic">hello_cargo</span>.
          We’ve named our project <span class="italic">hello_cargo</span>,
          and Cargo creates its files in a directory of the same name.
        </p>
        <p>Go into the <span class="italic">hello_cargo</span> directory and list the files.
          You’ll see that Cargo has generated two files and one directory for us:
          a <span class="italic">Cargo.toml</span> file and a <span class="italic">src</span> directory with a <span
            class="italic">main.rs</span> file inside.
          It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <span class="italic">.gitignore file</span>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change <code class="hlcode">cargo new</code>
            to use a different version control system or no version control system by using the
            <code class="hlcode">--vcs</code> flag. Run <code class="hlcode">cargo new</code>
            <code class="hlcode">--help</code> to see the available options.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Open <span class="italic">Cargo.toml</span> in your text editor of choice.
          It should look similar to the code in Listing 1-2.
        </p>
        <p>Filename: Cargo.toml</p>
        <pre class="hlcode">
<span class="hlcode--def">[package]</span>
<span class="hlcode--function">name</span> = <span class="hlcode--content">"hello_cargo"</span>
<span class="hlcode--function">version</span> = <span class="hlcode--content">"0.1.0"</span>
<span class="hlcode--function">authors</span> = [<span class="hlcode--content">"Your Name &ltyou@example.com&gt"</span>]
<span class="hlcode--function">edition</span> = <span class="hlcode--content">"2018"</span>

<span class="hlcode--def">[dependencies]</span></pre>
        <p>Listing 1-2: Contents of <span class="italic">Cargo.toml</span> generated by <code class="hlcode">cargo
            new</code></p>
        <p>This file is in the <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml" target="_blank">TOML</a>
          (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.
        </p>
        <p>The first line, <code class="hlcode">[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the following
          statements are configuring a package.
          As we add more information to this file, we’ll add other sections.
        </p>
        <p>The next four lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile your program: the name, the
          version,
          who wrote it, and the edition of Rust to use. Cargo gets your name and email information from your
          environment,
          so if that information is not correct, fix the information now and then save the file.
          We’ll talk about the <code class="hlcode">edition</code> key in Appendix E.
        </p>
        <p>The last line, <code class="hlcode">[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any of
          your project’s dependencies.
          In Rust, packages of code are referred to as crates. We won’t need any other crates for this project,
          but we will in the first project in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.
        </p>
        <p>Now open <span class="italic">src/main.rs</span> and take a look:</p>
        <p>Filename: src/main.rs</p>
        <pre class="hlcode">
<span class="hlcode--function">fn</span> <span class="hlcode--def">main</span>() {
        <span class="hlcode--def">println!</span>(<span class="hlcode--content">"Hello, world!"</span>);
}</pre>
        <p>Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one we wrote in Listing 1-1! So far,
          the differences between our previous project and the project Cargo generates are that Cargo placed the code in
          the src directory,
          and we have a <span class="italic">Cargo.toml</span> configuration file in the top directory.
        </p>
        <p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory.
          The top-level project directory is just for README files, license information, configuration files,
          and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you organize your projects.
          There’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place.
        </p>
        <p>If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello, world!” project,
          you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo.
          Move the project code into the src directory and create an appropriate <span class="italic">Cargo.toml</span>
          file.

        <p>
          This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust.
          Many programming languages have much in common at their core.
          None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
          but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain the conventions around using these concepts.
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.
          These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start
          from.
        </p>

          <h3>Keywords</h3>
          <p>The Rust language has a set of <span class="italic">keywords</span> that are reserved for use by the
            language only, much as in other languages.
            Keep in mind that you cannot use these words as names of variables or functions.
            Most of the keywords have special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
            programs;
            a few have no current functionality associated with them but have been reserved for functionality that might
            be added to Rust in the future.
            You can find a list of the keywords in Appendix A.
